#**Part 1: Factorial Function**

The objective of Part 1 is to write a function that computes the factorial of an integer greater than or equal to 0.

1. **factorial_code.R:** an R script file that contains the code implementing your classes, methods, and generics for the longitudinal dataset.
2. **factorial_output.txt:** a text file that contains the results of your comparison of the four different implementations.


#**Part 2: Longitudinal Data Class and Methods**

The purpose of this part is to create a new class for representing longitudinal data, which is data that is collected over time on a given subject/person. This data may be collected at multiple visits, in multiple locations.

1. **oop_code.R:** an R script file that contains the code implementing your classes, methods, and generics for the longitudinal dataset.

2. **oop_output.txt:** a text file containing the output of running the above input code.
